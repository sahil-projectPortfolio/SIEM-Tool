**SIEM IMPLEMENTATION REPORT**

**Introduction:**

This report documents the implementation of a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system using the ELK Stack. The purpose of the SIEM system is to detect, monitor, and respond to security incidents by collecting and analyzing security events and logs from various sources. The scope of the project includes setting up Elasticsearch, Auditbeat, and Kibana, and configuring them to collect and analyze logs from multiple sources.

**Setup and Configuration:**

1. Elasticsearch: Installed and configured Elasticsearch to store and search log data.
2. Auditbeat: Auditbeat is a lightweight shipper that you can install on servers to audit the activities of users and processes on systems.
3. Kibana: Installed and configured Kibana to create visualizations and dashboards for log analysis.

**Data Collection:**

- System Logs: Collected from Linux and Windows machines.
- Application Logs: Collected from web servers and databases.
- Network Logs: Collected from firewalls, routers, and switches.
- Security Tools Logs: Collected from IDS/IPS, antivirus, and SIEM.

**Analysis and Monitoring:**

1. Visualizations and Dashboards:

- Created a bar chart showing the count of failed login attempts over time.
- Created a line chart showing the volume of network traffic by source IP address.

2. Alerts:

- Configured an alert for multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address within 10 minutes.
- Configured an alert for high network traffic from a single IP address.

3. Investigation of Suspicious Activity:

- Investigated failed login attempts and identified the source IP address, usernames, and timestamps.
- Investigated unusual network traffic and determined the source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols involved.

**Findings:**

1. Indicators of Compromise:

- Multiple failed login attempts from IP address 192.168.1.100.
- Unusual network traffic from IP address 203.0.113.1.

2. Evidence of Malicious Activity:

- Unauthorized access attempts to sensitive accounts.
- High volume of data transfer to an external IP address.

**Conclusion:**

The SIEM implementation using the ELK Stack successfully provided the capability to collect, analyze, and monitor logs from various sources. The initial log analysis revealed evidence of unauthorized access attempts and unusual network activity. Recommendations for further action include strengthening access controls, implementing advanced network monitoring, and conducting a thorough review of security policies and procedures.
